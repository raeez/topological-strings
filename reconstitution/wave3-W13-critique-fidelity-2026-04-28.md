### Round 1 — hostile-referee attack (lines 14-572)

| #   | Short name                                     | Sev | Critique lines |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|-----|----------------|
| C01 | Title vs body: "Koszul duality" overclaims; PBW special-fibre is what is proved | 5 | 21-69 |
| C02 | Closed-open map: source-convention error (boundary observable starts from $f \in \bar A$ not from a CE cochain; Prop 0.2.18 perfectness) | 5 | 70-124 |
| C03 | Cotangent/descendant module mismatch: $\Psi_{a,b}$ vs $\rho_{a,b}$ coadjoint; even direction wrong; $h^\vee[1]\cong\langle\Psi_{a,b}\rangle$ as graded vec only | 5 | 125-172 |
| C04 | Cor 0.2.51 false on $f=z_1, g=z_2$: $\{Tr\phi_1,Tr\phi_2\}=N$, not zero; must say "after projection to Hamiltonian quotient" | 4 | 173-247 |
| C05 | "Central operation" Theorem 0.2.17 is too tautological in graded-commutative reduced model (ordinary Hochschild centrality automatic); only Poisson part is non-trivial; demote rhetorically | 3 | 248-281 |
| C06 | "Sector" is selected by hand: scalar trace, $Tr(\psi)$, higher-$\psi$ homology, finite-$N$ identities, coadjoint mismatch all excluded; introduction language overstates | 4 | 282-305 |
| C07 | Large-$N$ is algebraic, not physical: must distinguish $\mathrm{Prim}_{\mathrm{st}}$, $\mathrm{Conn}_{N\to\infty}$, Hamiltonian scalar quotient — three different operations | 3 | 306-332 |
| C08 | Reduced gauge/BV model suppresses quotient-stack issue: linearly reductive invariants vs CE/BRST cohomology — which model is being used must be explicit | 3 | 333-356 |
| C09 | One-$\psi$ homology proof under-proved: chip-moving / Abel-map needs full sign lemma, cellular-chain identification, attaching cells, stabilizer quotient, $S^1$-cycle ID | 4 | 357-385 |
| C10 | Tate / Koszul-duality formalism under-specified: which category of Tate spaces, which bar/cobar adjunction, conilpotency, completed PBW, continuity in length and Taylor degree, coadjoint topology preservation | 4 | 386-405 |
| C11 | Closed sector is formal BF, not yet physical closed string: no parent 11D background, no derived dimension count, no constructed twist, no derived defect from worldvolume, no QME, no propagator/kernel, no quantum graph | 3 | 406-438 |
| C12 | BCOV / Kodaira-Spencer analogy is dangerous: invites wrong comparison; use "Hamiltonian BF for formal symplectic disk" as primary terminology | 3 | 439-450 |
| C13 | Quantum section is target, not result: Moyal/Weyl is a target; Prop 0.2.52 only BRST-descents traces; commutator identity under quantum reduction left as Problem 0.2.54; Capelli/normal-ordering shift can feed lower traces | 4 | 451-470 |
| C14 | Central extension $\{Tr\phi_1,Tr\phi_2\}=N$ is physically meaningful (center-of-mass canonical pair), not disposable bookkeeping; same shift returns quantum mechanically; must be a named obstruction | 4 | 471-494 |
| C15 | Figures (pp. 41, 50, 51) are ornamental ovals; either remove or replace with real graph notation ($\Gamma_1, \Gamma_3, \mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma), P_\partial$, ordered boundary inputs) | 2 | 495-503 |
| C16 | Reference / notation cleanup: malformed citation labels ([13]razmyslov, [2]tsygan); Loday–Vallette index off by one | 2 | 504-511 |
| C17 | Defensible safe fallback theorem statement (Round 1 close-out): explicit bullet-form theorem with PBW SF comparison + boundary-evaluation Lie map after scalar quotient + descendant-module disclaimer | 3 | 512-572 |

### Round 2 — constructive derived-center proposal (lines 573-1492)

| #   | Short name                                     | Sev | Critique lines |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|-----|----------------|
| C18 | Insert CE/PV derived-Poisson-center theorem $C^\bullet_{\mathrm{CE}}(h\ltimes h^\vee[1])\cong Z^{P_0}_{\mathrm{fact}}(S(h))\simeq \mathrm{PV}(S(h))$ as central new section; replace Problem 0.2.20 by this theorem | 5 | 583-728 |
| C19 | Generator-level identification: $c^I\mapsto\theta^I=\partial/\partial O_I$, $u_I\mapsto O_I$; verify $\Phi d_{\mathrm{CE}}=d_\pi\Phi$ and $\Phi$ preserves $P_0$-bracket | 5 | 729-994 |
| C20 | Resolution of CE-source obstruction: $O_I=\mathrm{Tr}\,H_I(\phi_1,\phi_2)$ is image of $u_I$ (cotangent CE coord), not of $c^I$ (Hamiltonian ghost) | 5 | 995-1075 |
| C21 | Recovery: ordinary boundary bracket theorem is moment-map shadow of $\Phi$ at degree zero | 3 | 1076-1118 |
| C22 | Factorization version on intervals using $C_c^\infty(I)\otimes h$: verify locally constant factorization, multiplicativity over disjoint intervals | 4 | 1119-1213 |
| C23 | One-$\psi$ descendants belong to PBW-special-fibre $S(h\oplus h^\vee[1])$; principal-part module $\mathcal P=\bigoplus C\rho_{a,b}/(C\rho_{0,0})$ realizes $h^\vee_{\mathrm{cont}}$ as $h$-module, with $f\cdot\rho=\pi_{\mathrm{pp}}\{f,\rho\}$ | 5 | 1214-1318 |
| C24 | Replacement theorem statement for the paper: $\mathrm{Obs}^{\mathrm{cl}}_{\mathrm{closed},H}=C^\bullet_{\mathrm{CE,cont}}(h\ltimes h^\vee_{\mathrm{cont}}[1])\cong Z^{P_0}_{\mathrm{fact}}(A_\partial)$, with $c^I,u_I$ assignments and interval lift | 5 | 1369-1481 |

### Round 3 — Diracian rewrite (lines 1493-2493)

| #   | Short name                                     | Sev | Critique lines |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|-----|----------------|
| C25 | Voice/structure: paper should be Diracian, beginning with observables, brackets, locality of measurement (not "is this really a string theory") | 3 | 1500-1535 |
| C26 | First-principle origin of factorization algebra: independent local experiments, $\mathrm{Obs}(U_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathrm{Obs}(U_n)\to\mathrm{Obs}(V)$; $L_v=[Q,\iota_v]$ topological, $L_{\partial/\partial \bar z_i}=[Q,\iota_{\partial/\partial \bar z_i}]$ holomorphic | 4 | 1536-1593 |
| C27 | Forced first-order action from $\Omega_N$, moment-map $\mu_\epsilon$, and BV reduction $Q\psi=[\phi_1,\phi_2]$ as Dirac-constraint-in-homological-form | 4 | 1594-1690 |
| C28 | Three notions of locality must be derived: support locality on brane line ($\delta(t-s)$), topological locality ($L_v=[Q,\iota_v]$), formal-holomorphic / distributional locality transverse to brane | 4 | 2105-2150 |
| C29 | Cotangent boundary sector is distributionally local, not polynomially local: principal parts are residue functionals supported at brane (transverse delta-currents) | 4 | 2126-2150 |
| C30 | One-$\psi$ descendants role: PBW special-fibre, not deformation-level coadjoint; principal parts are true coadjoint; package as distributional boundary current sector $\Theta_\rho(a)$ with $\{O_f(a),\Theta_\rho(b)\}=\Theta_{f\cdot\rho}(ab)$, $\{\Theta_\rho,\Theta_\sigma\}=0$ | 4 | 2151-2244 |
| C31 | Unitarity: do not pretend the model is unitary; replacement is CME ($QI+\frac12\{I,I\}=0$) plus QME ($+\hbar\Delta I=0$) and factorization/OPE associativity; protected cohomological sector | 3 | 2245-2293 |
| C32 | Insertable Diracian opening (model passage): "Local measurements and constraints / The center / Locality / Unitarity / The actual thesis sentence" | 3 | 2294-2475 |
| C33 | Thesis sentence: "A stack of branes is a system of probes for the formal symplectic normal disk... closed observables are precisely the derived Poisson central operations on the stable open Hamiltonian brane algebra" | 3 | 2459-2474 |

### Round 4 — first-principles synthesis (lines 2480-...)

| #   | Short name                                     | Sev | Critique lines |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|-----|----------------|
| C34 | Paper is local BV/factorization, not global worldsheet string; downgrade global rhetoric | 3 | 2487-2530 |
| C35 | Reduce divergence-free polyvectors on $C^2$ to Hamiltonians via Poincare-lemma argument; justifies $\bar A=C[z_1,z_2]/C$ | 3 | 2812-2910 |
| C36 | Open brane sector first-principles construction from exact A-brane on $\mathbb R\subset T^*\mathbb R$ tensored with B-brane skyscraper $\mathcal O_0$ at origin; $\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_R(k,k)\simeq\Lambda(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$ via Koszul resolution | 3 | 2911-3050 |
| C37 | Dirac interpretation of open action: $\Omega_N=\mathrm{Tr}(d\phi_1\wedge d\phi_2)$, $A$ as multiplier, $\mu_\epsilon=-\mathrm{Tr}(\epsilon[\phi_1,\phi_2])$, BV antifield $\psi=A^*$ with $Q\psi=[\phi_1,\phi_2]$ | 4 | 3051-3157 |
| C38 | Local operators reduce to evaluation at insertion via $[d_R,\iota_{\partial_t}]=\partial_t$ jet-degree contraction (Euler argument) | 3 | 3158-3196 |
| C39 | Stable large-$N$ as Procesi–Razmyslov: $C[\mathfrak{gl}^{2\infty}]^{GL_\infty}_{\mathrm{st}}\cong S(\mathrm{Cyc}(F)_{\mathrm{nonempty}})$; $\mathrm{Tr}(1)=N$ not primitive stable; graded cyclicity for $\psi$ | 3 | 3197-3239 |
| C40 | Adjacent-swap exactness: $Q\mathrm{Tr}(\psi vu)=\mathrm{Tr}([\phi_1,\phi_2]vu)\Rightarrow\mathrm{Tr}(uxyv)-\mathrm{Tr}(uyxv)$ exact | 3 | 3240-3275 |
| C41 | One-$\psi$ descendants $\Psi_{k,l}$ definition + $Q$-closedness via cyclic transition counting; chip-moving / Abel-map proof of $H_1$ one-dimensional | 4 | 3276-3370 |
| C42 | Sector exclusion: $\mathrm{Tr}(\psi)=\Psi_{0,0}$ removed to match constant exclusion in $\bar A$; higher-$\psi$ primitive homology excluded | 3 | 3371-3384 |
| C43 | Closed Koszul dual / PBW-special-fibre comparison admits identification only as filtered graded-commutative product, not deformation-level coadjoint module — PRINCIPAL-PARTS CORRECTION REQUIRED | 4 | 3385-3450 |
| C44 | Degree-zero boundary map calculation: $\{Tr(\phi_1^k\phi_2^l),Tr(\phi_1^m\phi_2^n)\}=(kn-lm)Tr(\phi_1^{k+m-1}\phi_2^{l+n-1})$ after stable connected Hamiltonian quotient | 3 | 3451-3537 |
| C45 | Scalar central subtlety: $\{Tr\phi_1,Tr\phi_2\}=N$ pre-reduction; in reduced $\bar A$, $\{z_1,z_2\}=1\equiv 0\pmod C$; FORMULAS HOLD ONLY AFTER projection out of scalar trace class; reappears as Capelli/normal-ordering | 4 | 3538-3578 |
| C46 | CE-source obstruction is the root reason for derived-center: $\bar A$ perfect ($z_1^az_2^b=\{z_1,\frac{1}{b+1}z_1^az_2^{b+1}\}$); $d_{CE}\xi_{a,b}\ne 0$, no CE cocycle has linear Hamiltonian part | 4 | 3579-3653 |
| C47 | Corrected closed-open derived center theorem: with $\Phi(c^I)=\theta^I, \Phi(u_I)=O_I$, $\Phi d_{CE}=d_\pi\Phi$ is mechanical; bdy Hamiltonian = image of cotangent CE coord, not of $c^I$ | 5 | 3654-3895 |
| C48 | Why principal parts are necessary: continuous dual of $h$ realized by $\rho_{a,b}=z_1^{-a-1}z_2^{-b-1}dz_1\wedge dz_2$ via residue pairing $\langle\rho_{a,b},z_1^mz_2^n\rangle=\delta_{a,m}\delta_{b,n}$; exclusion $a+b>0$ matches removed constants | 4 | 3896-3976 |
| C49 | Principal-part coadjoint action: $z_1^pz_2^q\cdot\rho_{a,b}=-(pb-qa+p-q)\rho_{a-p+1,b-q+1}$; linear $z_1$ raises $b$ by one — not lowers — fix any sentence with the wrong direction | 4 | 3981-4044 |
| C50 | Polynomial descendants vs principal parts: $O_{1,0}: \Psi_{a,b}\mapsto b\Psi_{a,b-1}$ (lowers $b$) vs $z_1\cdot\rho_{a,b}=-(b+1)\rho_{a,b+1}$ (raises $b$) — direction opposite, hence not the same module | 5 | 4045-4112 |
| C51 | No-go theorem (no polynomial coadjoint realization): $O_{1,0},O_{0,1}$ act by constant derivations on polynomials hence locally nilpotent; principal-part action raises pole order indefinitely; local nilpotence preserved by module isomorphism | 5 | 4113-4159 |
| C52 | Local-dual boundary sector $M^{\mathrm{pp}}_\partial=H^2_{(z_1,z_2)}\otimes(dz_1dz_2)/C\rho_{0,0}$, $\Theta_{a,b}\leftrightarrow\rho_{a,b}$, $\{O_{p,q},\Theta_{a,b}\}=-(pb-qa+p-q)\Theta_{a-p+1,b-q+1}$, $\{\Theta,\Theta\}=0$, realizes $\bar A\ltimes \mathcal P[1]$ | 4 | 4160-4267 |
| C53 | Dirac interpretation of principal parts: position vs momentum analogy; Hamiltonian functions vs cotangent residue currents (transverse delta-currents at brane); brane is a defect, defect-localized duals are normal delta currents | 4 | 4269-4321 |
| C54 | Witten/open-closed interpretation: derived $P_0$-center contains functions, vector fields, higher polyvectors; closed BF fields = polyvector central operations on open brane phase space | 4 | 4322-4391 |
| C55 | Three notions of locality formalization: support locality / topological locality (locally constant) / formal-holomorphic-distributional locality | 4 | 4392-4445 |
| C56 | Unitarity replacement: CME $QI+\frac12\{I,I\}=0$ + QME $+\hbar\Delta I=0$ + factorization/OPE associativity + anomaly cancellation; protected twisted sector | 3 | 4446-4473 |
| C57 | Quantum Moyal target: $f\star g=m\circ\exp(\hbar P/2)(f\otimes g)$, $P=\partial_{z_1}\otimes\partial_{z_2}-\partial_{z_2}\otimes\partial_{z_1}$; coefficients $\hbar,\hbar^3/24,\hbar^5/1920,\hbar^7/322560$ for odd $r$ | 3 | 4474-4598 |
| C58 | Quantum matrix reduction Capelli obstruction: $YX-XY+\hbar NI=0$ in moment ideal $\Rightarrow Tr(AXY)-Tr(AYX)=\hbar N\,Tr(A)$; can feed lower-degree traces into connected sector; quantum part = target only, not theorem | 4 | 4599-4670 |
| C59 | Costello graph problem checklist: elliptic parent, defect conditions, gauge fix, propagator, anomaly, bulk-to-defect kernel, propagator/Weyl link, first-order graph normalization, third-order graph normalization to $1/24$, connected-trace extraction with Capelli treatment | 4 | 4671-4699 |
| C60 | Corrected global thesis: 3 main theorems (PBW stable trace + derived closed-open center + principal-parts cotangent realization), not one overloaded theorem | 5 | 4700-4805 |
| C61 | Errata 1 — principal-part linear action sign sentence ("$z_1$ lowers indices") is WRONG | 3 | 4806-4831 |
| C62 | Errata 2 — polynomial descendants do not simply "raise indices"; depends on $p+q$; the real point is action is not the coadjoint action | 3 | 4832-4850 |
| C63 | Errata 3 — paper's coadjoint formula $z_1^pz_2^q\cdot\rho_{a,b}=-(pb-qa+p-q)\rho_{a-p+1,b-q+1}$ is correct; treat as reference | 2 | 4851-4859 |
| C64 | Errata 4 — smeared bracket formula $\{I_\partial(a,f),I_\partial(b,g)\}=I_\partial(ab,\{f,g\}_{\bar A})$ requires connected Hamiltonian quotient by scalar trace; otherwise $f=z_1, g=z_2$ gives $N\int ab$ | 4 | 4860-4886 |
| C65 | Errata 5 — "removing constants" not literally "removing all $U(1)$ centre-of-mass": $Tr(1)=N$ removed, but $Tr\phi_1, Tr\phi_2$ remain | 2 | 4887-4910 |
| C66 | Errata 6 — full closed-open map can be sharpened: stalkwise CE/PV isomorphism is the abstract content; remaining work is implementing it inside unfrozen BV/factorization model with compact supports, de Rham/Dolbeault, defect kernels | 3 | 4911-4938 |
| C67 | Errata 7 — references and labels need cleanup ([13]razmyslov, [2]tsygan, PBW citation off-by-one) | 2 | 4939-4942 |
| C68 | Errata 8 — figures upgraded or demoted: schematic reminders only, label propagators / boundary vertices / aut factors / orientation, or keep explicitly informal | 2 | 4943-4948 |

### Round 5 — second-pass critique on v3 draft (lines 4949-...)

| #   | Short name                                     | Sev | Critique lines |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|-----|----------------|
| C69 | Persistent inconsistency: interval-wise factorization theorem still maps $(a\otimes f)^\vee[-1]$ to $B_f(a)$; this is the OLD MISTAKE in factorization form; the source must be the cotangent CE coord (label $u_{a\otimes f}$), not the Hamiltonian CE coord | 5 | 5081-5175 |
| C70 | $\Psi\to\rho$ cannot be a strict $P_0$-morphism: explicit counterexample at $f=z_1$ ($b\rho_{a,b-1}$ vs $-(b+1)\rho_{a,b+1}$); chain-level primitive projection claim must NOT assert strict $P_0$-bracket compatibility | 5 | 5176-5311 |
| C71 | Distinguish PBW special-fibre open descendant sector ($\Psi_{a,b}$) from new distributional/principal-part boundary sector ($\Theta_\rho$); do not define principal-part sector as $P_0$-quotient of polynomial $\Psi$-sector unless an honest intertwiner is constructed | 5 | 5312-5346 |
| C72 | "Interpolation by $\hbar$" claim is not a theorem: $\Psi$ vs $\rho$ are not two bases of same $h$-module (no-go from local nilpotence); to make interpolation real, construct Rees / Fourier-Borel $D_\hbar$-module $M_\hbar$ with two specializations | 5 | 5347-5455 |
| C73 | Factorization algebra must use $\Omega^\bullet_c(I)$ de Rham compact supports, not $C_c^\infty(I)$; the latter has no differential, inclusions of intervals not quasi-isomorphisms | 4 | 5456-5514 |
| C74 | Quantum radial-parts theorem is potentially huge but UNDERPROVED: list seven specific challenges (which radial-parts theorem; applies to all Weyl-ordered mixed traces; Calogero-Moser/Dunkl correction terms; radial map injectivity; quotient order; connected single-trace projection; stable cumulant extraction) — author as Theorem F$'$ "Radial-Moyal theorem for Weyl traces" with appendix-level proof | 5 | 5515-5613 |
| C75 | Weighted Tate completion is regulator, not the original strict dual: state explicitly that hierarchy: strict algebraic / weighted analytic regulator / regulator-independence comparison statement; without comparison, weighted Tate is not a completion of the original object | 4 | 5614-5683 |
| C76 | Principal-part module needs $D$-module proof, not "Schur rigidity": prove via $H^2_{(z_1,z_2)}(\mathbb C[z_1,z_2])dz_1dz_2/\mathbb C\rho_{0,0}$ + uniqueness from continuous degree-preserving pairing satisfying coefficient extraction and Hamiltonian integration by parts | 4 | 5684-5736 |
| C77 | Scalar anomaly section: phrase as the distinguished one-dimensional anomaly line in $H^2_{\mathrm{Lie}}$, not as "the one-dimensional sub-line of $H^2$" (avoid overstating one-dimensionality of full $H^2$) | 2 | 5737-5779 |
| C78 | Chain-level primitive projection should be RENAMED: "primitive Lie/$P_0$ quotient projection" or "primitive indecomposable shadow" — NOT cotangent factorization-center lift / factorization algebra equivalence; if quotient kills products of positive primitives it is not the same factorization object | 4 | 5780-5822 |
| C79 | Three physical principles structure: Dirac constrained probes / Witten closed-open centrality / Cotangent fields are transverse currents — should be the first section, makes factorization algebra physically inevitable | 3 | 5823-5908 |
| C80 | Strongest theorem package: 5 main theorems (Dirac probe / Derived center / Defect current factorization / Principal-parts coadjoint / Quantum radial Moyal); separate purely algebraic Theorem B from analytic Theorem C from quantum Theorem | 4 | 5909-5999 |
| C81 | Theorem D detailed: $h^\vee_{\mathrm{cont}}\cong\mathcal P=H^2_{(z_1,z_2)}(\mathbb C[z_1,z_2])dz_1dz_2/\mathbb C\rho_{0,0}$, residue pairing, coadjoint action; do NOT rely on "Schur rigidity" unless actually proved | 4 | 6000-6035 |
| C82 | Theorem E detailed: $\mathcal A^{\mathrm{pp}}_\partial(I)=S(h_I)\otimes S(\mathcal P_I[1])$ with independent $\Theta_\rho$ generators; ${B_f,\Theta_\rho}=\Theta_{f\cdot\rho}$, ${\Theta,\Theta}=0$; not from ordinary polynomial open observables | 4 | 6003-6235 |
| C83 | Theorem F decomposed: unconditional algebraic Moyal/Weyl target / conditional Costello graph realization; explicit separation of degree-zero quantum sector (proved if radial-parts identity holds) from full descendant/cotangent quantum lift (conditional on Tate/QME) | 4 | 6497-6502 |
| C84 | Cross-volume horizon material should NOT be in the main paper: dilutes core theorem; move to private convention appendix or separate "programmatic outlook"; transfers are local-only and non-transferable without matched-convention proofs | 4 | 6066-6076 |
| C85 | Replacement abstract draft (round 5): physics paragraph (mixed brane line, Dirac probe, $Q\psi=[\phi_1,\phi_2]$, closed shifted cotangent BF) + theorem paragraph (CE/PV derived-center, $u_x\mapsto O_x$, $c_\lambda\mapsto\theta_\lambda$, $\mathcal P$ as principal-part residues, PBW shadow status, $U(1)$ anomaly, Weyl/Moyal Capelli, Costello isolated) | 4 | 6077-6131 |
| C86 | Concrete Errata for v3 (round 5): 10 specific replacements listed; same as C61-C68 plus: (1) interval source ($u_{a\otimes f}\mapsto B_f(a)$), (2) $C_c^\infty(I)\to\Omega^\bullet_c(I)$, (3) delete "Ψ and ρ different bases of same module", (4) delete strict $P_0$-compatibility of $\Psi\to\rho$, (5) make principal-part currents independent boundary generators, (6) rename primitive projection, (7) strengthen or condition radial-parts theorem, (8) treat weighted Tate as regulator, (9) replace Schur rigidity with $D$-module / residue uniqueness, (10) move cross-volume material out | 5 | 6132-6257 |

### Round 6 — exhaustive technical punch list (lines 6306-...)

The following items are taken from the 201-item technical punch list. Numbered to match (round-6 item N = critique item C(86+N)).

| #   | Short name                                     | Sev | Critique lines |
|-----|------------------------------------------------|-----|----------------|
| C87 | Punch1: Reorganize paper around six clean theorem layers (Dirac/Stable trace/CE-PV/Principal-part/Factorization-current/Quantum) — split the umbrella theorem | 4 | 6394-6502 |
| C88 | Punch2: Fix central source-convention error in factorization theorem 0.2.21: $u_{a\otimes f}\mapsto B_f(a)$, $c_\lambda\mapsto\theta_\lambda$; propagate through 0.1.14(iii), 0.2.21, 0.2.23, abstract, factorization compatibility proof | 5 | 6503-6574 |
| C89 | Punch3: Replace $C_c^\infty(I)$ by $\Omega^\bullet_c(I)$ in all locally-constant factorization statements; degree-zero current formula recovered as top-degree component | 4 | 6578-6650 |
| C90 | Punch4: Remove "Ψ and ρ different bases of the same g-module" — most dangerous mathematical sentence in the draft; replace with two distinct module realizations of same PBW label set + named problem for Rees/Fourier interpolation | 5 | 6651-6761 |
| C91 | Punch5: Correct "raising/lowering" terminology for principal parts; replace with "coadjoint principal-part action" or "negative-transpose residue action"; add small explicit table $f\to f\cdot\rho_{a,b}$ effect | 3 | 6762-6818 |
| C92 | Punch6: Re-prove principal-part uniqueness using local cohomology / residue calculus, NOT Schur rigidity; uniqueness statement: residue pairing is unique continuous degreewise pairing satisfying coefficient extraction and Hamiltonian integration by parts after fixing $\langle\rho_{a,b},z_1^az_2^b\rangle=1$ | 4 | 6819-6858 |
| C93 | Punch7: Separate the three cotangent objects $u_I,\Psi_{a,b},\Theta_\rho$ via explicit dictionary table; add warning $\Psi_{a,b}\mapsto\rho_{a,b}$ is not a $P_0$-morphism | 4 | 6859-6920 |

| C95 | Punch9: Recast principal-part boundary sector as added enlarged reduced defect-current sector, NOT as derived from polynomial observables; explicit paragraph: "principal-part sector is not obtained from ordinary polynomial matrix observables; adjoined as reduced local-dual defect-current module forced by the coadjoint action" | 4 | 6971-7010 |

| C147 | Punch61: Finite-$N$ statement for commuting-pair quotient: BV complex is Koszul presentation of derived zero locus of moment map; $H^0$ is classical invariant ring; higher cohomology records derived intersection — avoid claiming Koszul exact beyond proven | 3 | 8689-8716 |
| C148 | Punch62: Clarify gauge BRST vs invariant reduction: "we compute invariant functions on derived moment-map zero locus, not the full BRST cohomology of infinitesimal gauge algebra"; group linearly reductive ⇒ invariants exact | 3 | 8718-8729 |

| C156 | Punch70: Quantum theorem source notation: $\Phi^{(0)}_\hbar(u_f)=J_\infty(f)$, $\Phi^{(0)}_\hbar(c_f)=$quantum derivation; degree-zero quantum theorem treats $u_f$-coordinate part of derived center | 3 | 8863-8898 |

| C197 | Punch111: "Full higher-$\psi$ problem" section as named research problem: complete primitive stable Koszul homology of $C\langle x,y,\psi\rangle_{\mathrm{cyc}}$ with $Q\psi=[x,y]$; current paper uses no-$\psi$ and one-$\psi$ Hamiltonian sectors only | 3 | 9787-9802 |
| C198 | Punch112: "Relation to cyclic homology" appendix: speculative/conjectural relation to LQT and derived commutative algebra; explain without overclaiming | 2 | 9803-9809 |
| C199 | Punch113: Fix notation $A,\bar A,A_\partial,A_\hbar$: define $A_{\mathrm{poly}}=\mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$, $\bar A=A_{\mathrm{poly}}/\mathbb C$, $h=\mathbb C[[z_1,z_2]]/\mathbb C$, $A_\partial=S(h)$, $A_{\partial,\mathrm{poly}}=S(\bar A)$ — use consistently | 3 | 9810-9849 |

| C201 | Punch115: Proof unweighted Casimir $C_h=\sum e_{d,i}\otimes e^i_d$ does not converge: second factor in $\prod H_d^\vee$, not $\bigoplus H_d^\vee$, hence $C_h\notin h\otimes h^\vee_{\mathrm{cont}}$ | 3 | 9876-9914 |
| C202 | Punch116: Clarify CE/PV theorem does not require Casimir: cochain algebraic derived center independent of BV propagator; Costello graph realization requires coefficient kernel | 3 | 9915-9933 |
| C203 | Punch117: Reassess "universal bar-cobar/Koszul template": full Hamiltonian algebra with linear and $H_2$ modes is not lower-central conilpotent; ensure theorem does not imply full $h$ uses conilpotent template | 4 | 9934-9948 |
| C204 | Punch118: Recast Tate Quillen section as "optional categorical enhancement: admissible Tate bar-cobar envelope" | 2 | 9949-9955 |

| C206 | Punch120: "Comparison with Gwilliam-Williams" compact paragraph: GW = holomorphic bosonic string on Riemann surface with critical dimension; this paper = local target-space Hamiltonian BF on $\mathbb R^2\times\mathbb C^2$; no imported critical dimension | 2 | 9973-9981 |
| C207 | Punch121: Remove apologetic phrasing: avoid "not a theorem", "only a shadow", "not yet"; use "the theorem is the reduced formal local theorem", "the analytic graph realization is a separate problem", "the PBW descendant sector is a special-fibre theorem" | 2 | 9982-9991 |
| C208 | Punch122: "Proof skeleton" before long proofs: identify generators / compute differential on generators / verify... | 2 | 9994-9999 |

| C213 | Punch127: Exact replacement for cotangent reduced theorem: $A^{\mathrm{pp}}_\partial(I)=S(h_I)\otimes S(\mathcal P_I[1])$ enlarged reduced principal-part defect-current model; $\partial^{\mathrm{pp}}_{\mathrm{bb}}(f)=B_f, \partial^{\mathrm{pp}}_{\mathrm{bb}}(\rho[1])=\Theta_\rho$, $\{B_f,\Theta_\rho\}=\Theta_{f\cdot\rho}$ — REDUCED $P_0$-MODEL, unreduced BV realization not automatic | 4 | 10093-10133 |
| C214 | Punch128: Exact replacement for quantum theorem status: degree-zero quantum theorem treats $u_f$-function part of derived center; proves Moyal commutator for Capelli-renormalized stable Weyl traces; cotangent/principal-part descendant sector remains conditional on weighted Tate/QME | 4 | 10134-10145 |
| C215 | Punch129: Theorem about open-line Weyl product independent of Costello: $F\star G=m\circ\exp(\hbar P_\partial/2)(F\otimes G)$ internal to reduced first-order open-line Weyl model; NOT Costello graph realization | 4 | 10147-10166 |

| C218 | Punch132: $P^3(z_1^4,z_2^4)$ coefficient consistency check: $(4)_3(4)_3=24\cdot 24=576$; in normalized bracket, $\hbar^2/24\cdot 576=24\hbar^2 z_1z_2$ | 2 | 10213-10268 |
| C219 | Punch133: "Finite $N$ vs $N$ in $\mathfrak m^N$" notation warning: avoid using $N$ both for matrix size and truncation order; use $R$ (rank) and $D$ (truncation degree) | 2 | 10269-10289 |
| C220 | Punch134: "Rank $N$ and truncation $D$" global convention | 2 | 10290-10295 |
| C221 | Punch135: Fix "dimension 1+4" phrasing: $\mathbb R^2\times\mathbb C^2$ is $2+4=6$ real dimensions; better notation $\mathbb R_{\mathrm{brane}}\times\mathbb R_{\mathrm{top,normal}}\times\mathbb C^2_{\mathrm{hol}}$ | 2 | 10296-10314 |
| C222 | Punch136: Notation for $x_1,x_2$ topological coordinates; brane is $\mathbb R_{x_1}\times\{x_2=0\}\times\{p\}$ | 2 | 10315-10324 |
| C223 | Punch137: Avoid "boundary" when it is a defect; brane is line defect not boundary of spacetime; use "bulk-to-defect" or "bulk-to-brane" | 3 | 10325-10339 |
| C224 | Punch138: "Bulk-to-boundary" vs "bulk-to-defect" convention disclaimer | 2 | 10340-10345 |

| C226 | Punch140: Treat noncommutative formal symplectomorphisms carefully: ordering ambiguities exact in $H^0(Q)$, formal Darboux acts on commutative Hamiltonian labels | 3 | 10364-10372 |
| C227 | Punch141: "Index conventions for monomials" note: $H_{a,b}=z_1^az_2^b$, $a,b\ge 0$, $a+b>0$; $H_{m,n}=0$ for $m<0,n<0,m+n=0$ after scalar reduction | 2 | 10373-10389 |
| C228 | Punch142: Sign of Hamiltonian vector field $X_f=(\partial_{z_1}f)\partial_{z_2}-(\partial_{z_2}f)\partial_{z_1}$, $\iota_{X_f}\omega=-df$, $X_f(g)=\{f,g\}$; keep convention globally | 3 | 10390-10432 |

| C230 | Punch144: Verify principal-part action signs against convention: $\langle f\cdot\rho,g\rangle=-\langle\rho,\{f,g\}\rangle$, derive $f\cdot\rho_{a,b}=-(pb-qa+p-q)\rho_{a-p+1,b-q+1}$ explicitly | 4 | 10464-10512 |
| C231 | Punch145: Clarify "negative-index targets zero" rule for principal-part action | 2 | 10513-10516 |

| C233 | Punch147: Fix any place saying $z_1$ lowers principal-part indices; raises $b$-pole order | 2 | 10564-10571 |
| C234 | Punch148: Compare polynomial descendant action $\Psi_{a,b}\mapsto b\Psi_{a,b-1}$ vs principal-part $\rho_{a,b}\mapsto -(b+1)\rho_{a,b+1}$ — opposite shift, different coefficient, different module | 4 | 10572-10609 |
| C235 | Punch149: Do not call polynomial action "raising" — use "symmetric PBW action" instead | 2 | 10610-10620 |
| C236 | Punch150: "Module mismatch lemma": $\Psi_{a,b}\mapsto\rho_{a,b}$ does not intertwine $z_1$; only label identification | 4 | 10621-10654 |
| C237 | Punch151: "Rees interpolation must change category": cannot live in ordinary polynomial modules; must pass through distributions or $D_\hbar$-modules | 4 | 10655-10661 |
| C238 | Punch152: Rework principal-parts note into paper section: bring in conceptual content, correct formulas | 3 | 10663-10668 |
| C239 | Punch153: Make "position vs momentum" analogy mathematically precise: functions↔coordinates on $h^\vee$, polyvector fields↔derivations, principal parts↔distributions supported at brane | 3 | 10669-10681 |
| C240 | Punch154: "Defect current" notation $\Theta_\rho(B)$ for $B\in\mathcal D'_c(I)$, smeared with $b(t)dt$; pair with $\Omega^\bullet_c(I)$ | 3 | 10683-10711 |
| C241 | Punch155: Clarify $\Theta_\rho$ parity: $\mathcal P[1]$ is shifted, state $|\Theta_\rho|=?$, verify $\{\Theta_\rho,\Theta_\sigma\}=0$ compatible with graded antisymmetry | 3 | 10712-10735 |
| C242 | Punch156: Finite-dimensional toy model BEFORE $\mathbb C[[z_1,z_2]]$: finite Lie $\mathfrak l$ with $C^\bullet_{\mathrm{CE}}(\mathfrak l\ltimes\mathfrak l^\vee[1])\cong\mathrm{PV}(S(\mathfrak l))$; intuition for infinite Tate case | 4 | 10736-10751 |
| C243 | Punch157: Exact toy proof: with basis $e_i$, $C^\bullet_{\mathrm{CE}}=S(u_i)\otimes\Lambda(c^i)$, $\mathrm{PV}(S(\mathfrak l))=S(O_i)\otimes\Lambda(\theta^i)$, $u_i\mapsto O_i, c^i\mapsto\theta^i$ becomes main theorem by completion | 4 | 10752-10782 |
| C244 | Punch158: "What is $Z^{P_0}_{\mathrm{fact}}$ on an interval?" — for locally constant factorization algebra from $A$, center stalk is Hochschild cochains; for Poisson compatibility, $P_0$-center is Poisson cochains; on intervals $Z^{P_0}_{\mathrm{fact}}(A_\partial)(I)\simeq\mathrm{PV}(A_\partial(I))$ | 3 | 10783-10814 |
| C245 | Punch159: Fix factorization product direction arrows; CE cochains contravariant unless using chains/cosheaves; recommendation: define every object as factorization algebra of compactly supported observables (covariant) | 4 | 10815-10843 |
| C246 | Punch160: Consider factorization coalgebras for CE cochains: $I\mapsto h_I$ cosheaf, CE chains naturally factorization coalgebra, CE cochains dual; compactly supported observables/density-duals so completed CE cochain assignment is covariant under extension by zero | 4 | 10846-10862 |
| C247 | Punch161: Exact treatment of compact support and distributions: source $h_I=\Omega^\bullet_c(I)\otimes h$ has compact support, dual involves distributions on $I$; $B_f(a)$ uses compactly supported density not a distribution; keep source and dual separate | 3 | 10863-10874 |
| C248 | Punch162: "Density vs function" convention: $a(t)$ in $\int a(t)dt$ is density $a(t)dt\in\Omega^1_c(I)$; avoid ambiguity | 3 | 10875-10887 |
| C249 | Punch163: Orientation convention for brane line; symplectic potential depends on orientation | 2 | 10889-10897 |
| C250 | Punch164: Clarify boundary terms in open action: reducing $\frac12\int Tr(\phi_1d\phi_2-\phi_2d\phi_1)$ to $\int Tr\phi_1d\phi_2$ discards boundary term — compactly supported variations / local operators in interior / fixed boundary values | 3 | 10898-10918 |
| C251 | Punch165: Prove gauge invariance of open action; move into Dirac theorem | 3 | 10920-10921 |

| C254 | Punch168: Define $\psi$ degree consistently: $Q\psi=[\phi_1,\phi_2]$ ⇒ $|Q|=1$ ⇒ $\psi$ degree $-1$ or $1$ depending on chain/cochain convention; state once | 3 | 10946-10954 |
| C255 | Punch169: Revisit "$S(V)$ means free graded-commutative algebra" with shifts: if $V[1]$ has parity reversed, $S(V[1])$ is exterior on even $V$; $S(\bar A_{\mathrm{desc}}[1])$ exterior if descendants odd | 3 | 10955-10970 |
| C256 | Punch170: "Odd ideal abelian" sign check: $[\rho[1],\sigma[1]]=0$ symmetric or antisymmetric depending on bracket degree; verify with $P_0$ convention | 3 | 10972-10977 |
| C257 | Punch171: Avoid calling $\mathcal P[1]$ "odd local-dual ideal" without degree convention; use "shifted local-dual ideal" with degree | 2 | 10982-10989 |
| C258 | Punch172: Insert proof of Jacobi for $A^{\mathrm{pp}}_\partial$: $[f,[g,\rho]]-[g,[f,\rho]]=[[f,g],\rho]$ by coadjoint representation; smearing $a(bB)-b(aB)=abB$ for smooth $a,b$ and distribution $B$ | 3 | 10990-11003 |
| C259 | Punch173: "Do not multiply distributions" note in Jacobi proof: bracket of two $\Theta$'s set to zero avoids distribution products | 4 | 11004-11006 |
| C260 | Punch174: Exact definition of $f\cdot\rho=\pi_{\mathrm{pp}}\{f,\rho\}$: define as Lie derivative $f\cdot\rho=-\mathcal L_{X_f}\rho$ (negative Lie derivative for coadjoint on densities); verify sign against formula | 4 | 11007-11032 |
| C261 | Punch175: Use "residue currents" instead of "Laurent forms" when emphasizing physics | 2 | 11033-11042 |

| C263 | Punch177: Re-evaluate "unique $h$-equivariant continuous pairing": equivariance follows for pairing between $\mathcal P$ and $h$, but uniqueness "of total degree zero" requires proof or replace with "canonical" | 3 | 11047-11051 |
| C264 | Punch178: Local cohomology exact sequence $H^2_\mathfrak{m}(R)\cong\mathbb C[z_1^{-1},z_2^{-1}]/(\mathbb C[z_1,z_1^{-1}]+\mathbb C[z_2,z_2^{-1}])$ or Čech model — grounds $\mathcal P$ | 3 | 11052-11066 |
| C265 | Punch179: Čech representative $H^2_\mathfrak{m}(R)=R[z_1^{-1},z_2^{-1}]/(R[z_1^{-1}]+R[z_2^{-1}])$, basis $z_1^{-a-1}z_2^{-b-1}$, multiply by $dz_1dz_2$ | 3 | 11067-11086 |
| C266 | Punch180: Tie principal parts to Verdier / local duality: $H^2_\mathfrak{m}(R)dz_1dz_2$ is Matlis dual of completed local ring $R^\wedge_\mathfrak{m}$ — exactly the continuous dual | 4 | 11087-11106 |
| C267 | Punch181: "Matlis dual" phrase: $\mathcal P\simeq\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{cont}}(\mathbb C[[z_1,z_2]]/\mathbb C,\mathbb C)$ is the reduced Matlis dual | 4 | 11107-11115 |
| C268 | Punch182: Recast principal-part theorem in Matlis dual language: "reduced Matlis dual of $h$ is $\mathcal P$, Hamiltonian Lie derivative realizes coadjoint action" — much more standard than "principal-part residue module" alone | 4 | 11116-11119 |
| C269 | Punch183: Continuity of residue pairing: continuous functional on $\mathbb C[[z_1,z_2]]$ with $\mathfrak m$-adic topology depends on finitely many coefficients; $\mathcal P$ as direct sum of $\rho_{a,b}$ exactly gives finite coefficient-extraction sums; weighted product $\mathcal P^w$ different completion | 3 | 11120-11135 |
| C270 | Punch184: Clarify completed $h^\vee$ in closed BF action: direct sum (finite Taylor-dual support for $\beta$) vs weighted product (infinite dual support for $\beta$); state which model each theorem uses | 4 | 11136-11150 |
| C271 | Punch185: "Strict model" vs "weighted model" notation: $g_{\mathrm{str}}=h\ltimes\mathcal P[1]$ vs $g^w=h^w\ltimes\mathcal P^w[1]$; do not use same $g$ for both | 4 | 11151-11168 |
| C272 | Punch186: "Dense inclusion" theorem $\mathcal P\hookrightarrow\mathcal P^w$ for finite-support principal parts; strict polynomial sector embeds into weighted regulator | 3 | 11169-11178 |
| C273 | Punch187: Exact statement of graphwise RG limitation: each fixed graph controlled, but not convergence of sum over graphs; "graphwise boundedness is not perturbative renormalizability by itself" | 4 | 11179-11186 |
| C274 | Punch188: Move Costello-Li failure analysis to appendix or keep concise; main text summarizes (noncompact, mixed top-hol, brane defect, $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ not $\mathfrak{gl}(N|N)$, coefficient Tate direction) | 3 | 11187-11197 |
| C275 | Punch189: Avoid sounding like you refute Costello-Li; say "Costello-Li theorem is not applicable to this local mixed defect model without additional work" | 3 | 11198-11210 |
| C276 | Punch190: "Why ordinary $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ retains $U(1)$ anomaly" paragraph: Costello-Li supertrace cancellation uses $\mathfrak{gl}(N|N)$; ordinary $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ has trace $N$; tie to $[\bar c]$ | 3 | 11211-11220 |
| C277 | Punch191: Clarify "Capelli shift as $U(1)$ charge": $\hbar N$ is charge of central direction; $Tr(I)=N$ ⇒ central moment relation has scalar $N$ | 3 | 11221-11230 |
| C278 | Punch192: "Background independence" caveat: formal local model depends only on formal Darboux disk; global backgrounds require choices | 3 | 11231-11234 |
| C279 | Punch193: "Minimal theorem-only version" appendix: 3 pure math theorems extractable (CE cochains of $T^*[1]h$ = Poisson cochains of $S(h)$ / $h^\vee_{\mathrm{cont}}=\mathcal P$ for $h=\mathbb C[[z_1,z_2]]/\mathbb C$ / stable trace yields $S(\bar A\oplus\bar A_{\mathrm{desc}}[1])$) | 3 | 11235-11253 |
| C280 | Punch194: "Physics-only summary" appendix (2 pages); helps interdisciplinary readership | 2 | 11254-11257 |
| C281 | Punch195: Theorem name consistency check: avoid "Koszul duality" for CE/PV center / "factorization equivalence" when reduced post-contraction / "universal" when conditional / "closed string" when formal local closed sector | 3 | 11258-11270 |
| C282 | Punch196: Replacement table of contents (12 sections: Dirac probes / local mixed BV model / open brane reduction stable traces / closed Hamiltonian BF / CE/PV derived-center / principal parts / factorization on brane line / PBW SF descendants / scalar anomaly / quantum Weyl/Moyal / weighted Tate regulator / appendices) | 4 | 11271-11288 |
| C283 | Punch197: Move Tate Quillen equivalence after CE/PV theorem; do not introduce model category before central theorem | 3 | 11289-11293 |
| C284 | Punch198: Move "Cross-volume convention contract" out of paper entirely; keep as private doc | 4 | 11294-11296 |

| C286 | Punch200: Highest-priority edits "do these first" (10 items: $u$-source, $\Omega^\bullet_c$, delete same-module sentence, no-go lemma, Schur ⇒ local-cohomology, rename pp sector, split umbrella theorem, claim-strength ledger, cross-volume out, sign-convention appendix) | 5 | 11309-11346 |
| C287 | Punch201: One-paragraph strongest-version vision: theorem-driven Dirac-Witten local model; brane stack as constrained matrix probe of formal symplectic disk; closed CE observables as derived Poisson central operations on open algebra; polynomial $\Psi_{a,b}$ as PBW SF shadow; principal parts as transverse residue currents; $U(1)$ anomaly same class classically and quantum; $W/M$ deformation governs degree-zero quantum sector; Costello graph realization isolated as analytic theorem | 5 | 11347-11366 |

| C04 (Cor 0.2.51 false) | A | §3 Thm G action items (lines 446-449), §6 item 4 implicit | M-12 | Scalar reduction made explicit; M-12 differentiates index-pair vs trace-pair Capelli |
| C05 (Tautological centrality) | A | §7 N11 (lines 781-792) | — | Plan calls out: "ordinary Hochschild centrality of $O_f$ is tautological in graded-commutative reduced models, but the non-trivial statement is Poisson centrality" |
| C06 (Sector selected by hand) | A | §3 Thm B critical disclaimer (lines 220-225); §6 item 3 | — | Sector exclusions remain explicit |
| C07 (Three large-$N$) | A | §7 N10 (lines 770-779) | M-10 | Plan dedicates one-page subsection; M-10 already named distinguishing operations on empty trace |

| C11 (Closed sector formal BF) | A | §0 (lines 26-35); §1 thesis (lines 80-105); §5 reorganization (lines 583-594) | — | Plan adopts "Hamiltonian BF for formal symplectic disk" as primary terminology |

| C13 (Quantum target only) | A | §3 Thm F (lines 391-425); §4 Obligations IV-V; §0 D-status conditional | M-03 | Theorem F$'$ explicitly conditional; Obligation V the analytic theorem |
| C14 (Central extension U(1)) | A | §3 Thm G (lines 426-449); §6 item 7 | M-09, M-12, M-32 | Plan promotes scalar anomaly; M-09 weight-bidegree decomp; M-12 trace vs index pair |
| C15 (Figures ornamental) | S | — | — | No explicit plan section addresses figures; plan's appendix list does not include "upgrade or remove figures" |
| C16 (Citation cleanup) | A | §6 item 11 (lines 668-675) | — | Citation audit; precise factor $P_0$-centre citation requested |
| C17 (Defensible safe theorem) | A | §3 Thm B + Thm C; §6 item 5 | — | Plan's explicit decomposition into A-G blocks subsumes the safe-fallback |

### Round 2 — constructive derived-center proposal (C18–C24)

| # | Class | Plan ref | Master ref | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C18 (CE/PV center theorem) | A | §1 (lines 80-105); §3 Thm C (lines 236-291); §7 N1 | M-01 | Central platonic theorem; M-01 splits into C₁/C₂ |

| C23 (One-$\psi$ + principal-part) | A | §3 Thm D (lines 292-340); §6 items 3-7 | M-02 | Plan installs principal-part module + no-go |

### Round 6 — exhaustive technical punch list (C87–C287)

For brevity, I summarize this large round in groups; detailed mapping in the audit section below.

**Architectural / structural items (C87, C88, C89, C90, C99, C100, C101, C102, C103, C104, C111, C123, C175, C176, C181, C184, C196, C282, C286).** Class **A** in plan via §3 (theorem blocks), §5 (reorganization), §6 (surgical list), §7 (constructions N1-N11), §8 (sequencing). These are the main edits the plan converts into actionable phases.

**Sign / convention / topology items (C97, C107, C115, C120, C133, C134, C137, C138, C144, C145, C146, C147, C148, C168, C169, C170, C171, C172, C228, C229, C230, C231, C232, C233, C249, C250, C254, C262, C264, C265).** Class **A or P** mostly via §6 item 8 sign appendix and §3 Thm D action items. M-04, M-07, M-25 in master ledger. C133 ($N$ vs truncation $D$ notation collision) is **S** — plan does not warn against this collision.

**Notation / glossary / dictionary items (C118, C119, C138, C174, C199, C220, C221, C222, C223, C224).** Class **A** via §6 item 12 notation index (lines 676-687) and §10 success criteria. Some specifics like C138 "physical dictionary table" appear in spirit but not as an explicit row table.

**Errata / formula / sign-correctness items (C61-C68 echoed in C217, C218, C232, C234, C235, C236, C237).** Class **A** uniformly.

**Distributional locality / cosheaf / factorization-foundations items (C140, C141, C153, C158, C159, C160, C161, C162, C167, C173, C246, C247, C248, C257, C258, C259, C260, C261).** Class **A or P** via §3 Thm E + §7 N9 + §6 item 2; M-23, M-24, M-36 sharpen. C173 (Costello-Li failure / refutation tone) is **S** in the plan body since it advises moving to appendix without specifying.

**Cross-volume / outlook items (C111, C123, C124, C137, C176, C284).** Class **A** via §9.

**Specific punch items not addressed by plan (silent drops, S):**

| # | Title | Why dropped / suggested reincorp |
|---|-------|-----------------------------------|
| C15, C68, C167 | Figures upgrade or removal — explicit graph notation requirements | **S**. Plan does not call for figure surgery. **Reincorp:** add §6 item 13 "Figure discipline: every diagram must show $\Gamma$, $\mathrm{Aut}\,\Gamma$, $P_\partial$, boundary order, kernel orientation, coefficient — or be labeled schematic-only." |
| C38 | Jet-contraction Euler argument $[d_R,\iota_{\partial_t}]=\partial_t$ derivation | **S**. Plan invokes locally-constant factorization but not the explicit jet-contraction reduction. **Reincorp:** add proof step to Theorem A's action items. |
| C133, C219, C220 | Notation collision: $N$ for matrix size vs $\mathfrak m^{N+1}$ truncation | **S**. Plan does not warn. **Reincorp:** add to §6 item 12 notation index a "rank vs truncation" disambiguation row. |
| C145 | BF pairing degree justification ($|\alpha|+|\beta|$ for top form $p+q=4$) | **S**. Plan signs convention appendix is silent on BF pairing degrees per se. **Reincorp:** add to §6 item 8 sign appendix. |
| C147 | Finite-$N$ commuting variety not complete intersection | **A** via M-03 in master ledger; **but plan does NOT mention this** in §2-§7. Plan's finite-algebraic-model is silent on derived intersection re-narration. **Critical reincorp:** add §3 Theorem A action item invoking M-03's BV-computes-derived-intersection narrative. |
| C171 (basis-dependence language) | Basis-independent structure of CE/PV map | **P**. Plan's coord-free Lichnerowicz proof addresses this; not made explicit. **Reincorp:** §7 N1 should call out coordinate-free covariance separately. |
| C207 | "Apologetic phrasing" replaced with theorem-driven language | **A** via §5 voice (line 599-602); but specific phrases ("not a theorem", "only a shadow") not flagged. **Reincorp:** §5 voice should add explicit phrase blacklist. |
| C227 | Index conventions for monomials (negative-index targets zero) | **P**. Plan's sign appendix (item 8) is silent on negative-index conventions. **Reincorp:** add to §6 item 8 sign appendix. |
| C239, C240, C241 | $\Theta_\rho$ pairing/parity precision; "defect current" notation $\Theta_\rho(B)$ | **P**. Plan installs $\Theta_\rho$ but parity/pairing rules not made explicit. **Reincorp:** add to §6 item 12 notation index or §7 N9. |
| C243 | Toy proof at finite Lie $\mathfrak l$: $C^\bullet_{\mathrm{CE}}(\mathfrak l\ltimes\mathfrak l^\vee[1])\cong\mathrm{PV}(S(\mathfrak l))$ | **P**. Plan's §7 N1 mentions this toy warm-up but does not number it as a theorem; only "includes the toy finite-dimensional warm-up". **Reincorp:** elevate to a numbered Lemma in N1. |
| C273 | Graphwise RG limitation: graphwise-bounded ≠ perturbatively renormalizable | **S**. Plan's Costello checklist (Obligation V, N8) does not flag this distinction explicitly. **Reincorp:** add to §4 Obligation V. |
| C274, C275 | Costello-Li failure analysis location and tone | **P**. Plan moves cross-volume to private appendix; Costello-Li-failure analysis is not addressed by name. **Reincorp:** add §4 Obligation V or Phase 4 outlook clarification. |
| C254 | $\psi$ degree consistency ($-1$ vs $+1$) | **P**. Plan's sign appendix (item 8) covers $V[1]^n$ convention; $\psi$-degree thread not flagged. **Reincorp:** add to §6 item 8 sign appendix. |

**Already-addressed items via M-XX entries (typical mapping):**

| Critique | Plan + Master |
|---|---|
| C09, C41 (one-$\psi$ proof strengthening) | §3 Thm B action items + §7 N2 |
| C61, C232, C233 (PP sign direction) | §6 item 8 + §3 Thm D action |
| C70 ($\Psi\to\rho$ not strict $P_0$) | M-02 + §6 item 6 / Thm D no-go |

| C77, C107, C162 (anomaly line) | M-09 + §3 Thm G action |
| C78, C95 (primitive projection rename / enlarged reduced sector) | M-15 + §6 item 6 / item 7 |
| C107, C162 (full $H^2$ classification) | M-09 |
| C109 (three large-$N$) | M-10 + §7 N10 |
| C112 (regulator independence admissible-only) | M-11 + §4 Obl III |
| C103 (Theorem 0.2.21 split) | M-16 + §6 item 1 + §3 Thm E correction |
| C115 (radial-parts armoring) | §3 Thm F$'$ + §7 N3 |
| C159, C160 (factorization arrows / coalgebra direction) | M-04 + M-24 |
| C204 (Tate Quillen as enhancement) | M-01 (split into C₁/C₂) + §3 Thm C |
| C266, C267, C268 (Matlis dual language) | §3 Thm D + appendix-matlis |
| C277 (Capelli shift trace pair) | M-12 + §3 Thm G |
| C284 (cross-volume out entirely) | §9 + §6 item 10 |
| C286 (highest-priority edits) | §6 + appendix to §10 |

## T4. Silent-drop and Dilution Audit

### Silent drops requiring reincorporation (S items)

| Critique | Severity | Reincorporation proposal |
|---|---|---|
| **C15, C68, C167** (Figures discipline) | 2 | **W3-W13-1: §6 item 13 (new) — Figure discipline.** Every diagram must display $\Gamma$, $\|\mathrm{Aut}\,\Gamma\|$, $P_\partial$, boundary order, kernel orientation, coefficient — OR be explicitly labeled "schematic only; not used in proof." |
| **C38** (Euler jet contraction explicit) | 3 | **W3-W13-2: §3 Theorem A action item.** Add "Derive local-operator reduction explicitly from $[d_R,\iota_{\partial_t}]=\partial_t$ Euler-type contraction, showing each local cohomology class has a representative depending only on field values at the insertion point, not derivatives." |
| **C133, C219, C220** (rank-$N$ vs truncation-$N$ notation collision) | 2 | **W3-W13-3: §6 item 12 notation index — add disambiguation row.** Use $N$ for brane rank and $D$ for Taylor truncation; existing $\mathfrak m^{N+1}$ notation in `tate-T2` should be recast as $\mathfrak m^{D+1}$. |
| **C145** (BF pairing degree justification) | 3 | **W3-W13-4: §6 item 8 sign-convention appendix — add subsection.** Compute $\|\alpha\|+\|\beta\|=p+q-3$ for top form $p+q=4$, and reconcile with claimed BV pairing degree $-1$. Ensure no mismatch between $\alpha$-shift ($[1]$) and $\beta$-shift ($[2]$) is silently absorbed. |
| **C147** (Finite-$N$ commuting variety not Koszul; BV computes derived intersection) | 4 | **W3-W13-5: PROMOTE M-03 to §3 Theorem A preface AND §3 Theorem G re-narration.** Master ledger M-03 already names this; plan does not propagate. Add Theorem-A action item: "for $N\ge 2$ the commuting variety is not a complete intersection (Premet 2003; Vasconcelos 1994); the open BV complex computes the derived intersection, $Tr\,\psi$ is a chain-level avatar of the derived intersection class." Add Theorem-G action item: "the $\hbar N$ Capelli shift is the U(1)$_{\mathrm{ghost}}$ one-loop anomaly of the derived intersection." |
| **C273** (graphwise-bounded ≠ renormalizable) | 4 | **W3-W13-6: §4 Obligation V — clarification.** Add: "graphwise-boundedness is not perturbative renormalizability by itself. The full effective interaction is a formal sum over graphs and loop order; locality and QME are separate from graphwise control. The weighted Tate argument controls each fixed graph; convergence over graphs is open." |
| **C274, C275** (Costello-Li failure analysis tone and location) | 3 | **W3-W13-7: §4 Obligation V — Costello-Li addendum.** Add: "Costello-Li's theorem is not applicable to this local mixed defect model without additional work — the model is noncompact, mixed topological-holomorphic, brane-defect at codimension 5, uses ordinary $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ (not $\mathfrak{gl}(N\|N)$), and has the coefficient Tate direction. Each non-applicability is a separate reduction step." |

### Dilution items where critique severity > plan response priority (P items)

| Critique | Severity | Plan response | Sharpening proposal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C08** (Quotient stack vs invariant reduction) | 3 | §3 Theorem A statement is silent on the distinction algebraic-invariants-vs-CE/BRST | **W3-W13-8: §3 Theorem A action item.** Add explicit statement: "We compute invariant functions on the derived moment-map zero locus, not the full BRST cohomology of infinitesimal gauge algebra. The group $\mathrm{GL}_N$ is linearly reductive in characteristic zero, hence invariants are exact." |
| **C35** (Divergence-free $\Rightarrow$ Hamiltonian via Poincaré lemma) | 3 | §2 Principle 1 asserts but does not derive | **W3-W13-9: §2 Principle 1 expansion.** Add explicit derivation: $\partial_\Omega X=0\Leftrightarrow d(\iota_X\omega)=0$; on formal disk Poincaré lemma kills closed 1-forms ⇒ $\iota_X\omega=-df\Rightarrow X=X_f$. Justifies $\bar A=\mathbb C[z_1,z_2]/\mathbb C$. |
| **C36** (Open brane sector first-principles A-brane $\otimes$ B-brane $\otimes$ Koszul resolution) | 3 | §3 Theorem A asserts BV reduction but does not derive Ext-algebra origin | **W3-W13-10: §3 Theorem A proof skeleton expansion.** Add: "Open string states $= \Omega^\bullet(\mathbb R)\otimes\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_{\mathbb C[z_1,z_2]}(\mathcal O_0,\mathcal O_0)\otimes\mathfrak{gl}_N[1]$; via Koszul resolution $\mathrm{Ext}^\bullet_R(k,k)\simeq\Lambda(\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2)$, the ghost-zero open field is $A+\phi_1\epsilon_1+\phi_2\epsilon_2$, recovering the first-order action." |
| **C171** (Basis-independence of CE/PV) | 3 | §7 N1 mentions Lichnerowicz coordinate-free proof; does not separately call out covariance under formal symplectomorphism | **W3-W13-11: §7 N1 expansion.** Add explicit covariance statement and link to M-05 (Symp$(\mathbb C^2,0)$ functoriality). The CE/PV map is canonical on the linear Poisson space $\mathfrak h^\vee$; the formula is basis-dependent but the map is not. |
| **C207** (Apologetic phrasing blacklist) | 2 | §5 voice (lines 599-602) generic | **W3-W13-12: §5 voice — explicit blacklist.** Add: avoid "not a theorem", "only a shadow", "not yet"; replace by "the theorem is the reduced formal local theorem", "the analytic graph realization is a separate problem", "the PBW descendant sector is a special-fibre theorem." |
| **C227** (Negative-index targets zero rule) | 2 | §6 item 8 sign appendix is silent | **W3-W13-13: §6 item 8 sign appendix expansion.** State: "if $a-p+1<0$ or $b-q+1<0$, the target $\rho_{a-p+1,b-q+1}$ is absent and the action is zero. This is the convention behind the $a+b>0$ exclusion in $\mathcal P$." |
| **C239–C241** ($\Theta_\rho$ pairing/parity precision) | 3 | §3 Thm D installs $\Theta_\rho$ but parity/pairing/density-vs-distribution rules elided | **W3-W13-14: §6 item 12 notation index expansion.** Add: $\|\Theta_\rho\|=$ explicit shift; $\Theta_\rho(B)$ for $B\in\mathcal D'_c(I)$; pairing with $\Omega^\bullet_c(I)$. |
| **C243** (Finite Lie toy proof numbered) | 4 | §7 N1 mentions; not numbered | **W3-W13-15: §7 N1 — promote toy.** Make the finite-dimensional warm-up a numbered Lemma: "For finite Lie $\mathfrak l$, $C^\bullet_{\mathrm{CE}}(\mathfrak l\ltimes\mathfrak l^\vee[1])\cong\mathrm{PV}(S(\mathfrak l))$; the map $u_i\mapsto O_i, c^i\mapsto\theta^i$ becomes the main theorem by completion." |
| **C254** ($\psi$ degree consistency) | 3 | §6 item 8 covers $V[1]^n$; $\psi$-degree thread not flagged | **W3-W13-16: §6 item 8 sign appendix expansion.** Add subsection: $Q\psi=[\phi_1,\phi_2]$ ⇒ $\|Q\|=1$ ⇒ $\|\psi\|=-1$ in cohomological / $+1$ in chain convention; state once. |
| **C92** (Local-cohomology proof for principal-part uniqueness — already addressed by M-06 but mid-tier dilution) | 4 | §3 Thm D action items + §6 item 5 + M-06 (rename + split) | OK — convergent. |

### Items where master ledger has entries but plan does not propagate

These are cases where M-XX exists in `attack-heal-platonic-2026-04-28.md` but the plan does not (yet) reflect the heal.

| Master ID | Plan status | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **M-01** (Theorem C split into C₁ / C₂) | Plan does NOT split Theorem C; plan §3 Theorem C is still monolithic | **W3-W13-17: §3 Theorem C update.** Split into C₁ (generator-level identity, hypothesis-free) and C₂ (bar-cobar / PBW consequence on admissible Tate-conilpotent windows). Plan must absorb M-01's structural reformulation. |
| **M-02** (Obligation II structural impossibility) | Plan §4 Obligation II says "must change category — Rees / holonomic $D_\hbar$-modules"; M-02 sharpens to "no $\mathfrak h$-equivariant solution; categorical reformulation open" | **W3-W13-18: §4 Obligation II reformulation.** Reword: "The maximal honest comparison is the Fourier-Rees bridge of `\thm:app-matlis-rees-fourier-bridge` (graded-vector-space identification only on the labelled basis; no $\mathfrak h$-equivariance). No $\mathfrak h$-equivariant Rees-flat $D_\hbar$-module candidate realizes both fibres simultaneously (verified against 21-case sweep). The open question is whether any category-changing construction (derived $D_\hbar$-modules, perverse sheaves at the conormal, factorization $D_\hbar$-bimodules) can carry both fibres equivariantly." |
| **M-03** (Derived intersection re-narration) | Plan does NOT mention finite-$N$ commuting variety not being Koszul | **W3-W13-5** above |
| **M-07** (Shift inconsistency $[-1]$ vs $[+1]$) | Plan §6 item 8 calls for sign appendix but does not specifically resolve shift inconsistency | **W3-W13-19: §6 item 8 sign appendix.** Add: "Pick the manuscript's standard $[1]$ convention; align all references to $[1]$. Resolve `main.tex`:2206 vs 3449 contradiction." |
| **M-09** (Weight-bidegree decomposition lemma) | Plan §3 Thm G action items mention but do not prove the weight-bidegree decomposition | **W3-W13-20: §3 Theorem G action item.** Add: "Author $\mathrm{lem:weight-bidegree-anomaly}$ in Theorem G area: $H^2_{\mathrm{Lie}}(\bar A;\mathbb C)$ is bigraded by weight $(p,q)$; weight-$(0,0)$ component is one-dimensional, spanned by $\bar\omega$." |
| **M-11** ($q\to 1^+$ forbidden, admissible-only) | Plan §4 Obligation III says "stabilises as $q\to 1^+$" — DIRECTLY VIOLATED | **W3-W13-21: §4 Obligation III rewording.** "For any two admissible weights $q,q'>1$, the weighted constructions give canonically equivalent finite-degree local observables. Stabilisation as $q\to 1^+$ is NOT asserted: forbidden by `\thm:strict-unweighted-no-go`. Admissible-window finite-degree observable computation is what stabilises, not the strict-weight limit." |
| **M-13** (bosonic vs $\mathfrak{gl}(N\|N)$ supertrace) | Plan does not mention | **W3-W13-22: §3 Theorem A or §1 thesis statement.** Add one-sentence remark: "The brane stack is the bosonic $\mathfrak{gl}_N$ Dirac probe; a $\mathfrak{gl}(N\|N)$ supertrace alternative would be a different super-stacked model with anti-branes, and is not studied here." |
| **M-14** (Weiss-cosheaf descent) | Plan §4 Obligation VII (global descent) covers in spirit; not explicit | **W3-W13-23: §4 Obligation VII expansion.** Make Weiss-cosheaf descent on $\mathbb R^2\times\mathbb C^2$ explicit residual (currently buried in "global descent"); preserve as named open obligation per M-14. |
| **M-32** (U(1)$_{\mathrm{ghost}}$ regularization-compatible) | Plan §3 Thm G or §4 Obligation IV does not engage with M-32's distinction "regularization-compatible vs anomaly-canceling" | **W3-W13-24: §4 Obligation IV expansion.** Add the M-32 distinction: "The mechanism (a) closed exchange-graph contributions, (b) supertrace, (c) central-character / normal-ordering counterterm — is a regularization-compatible question. Do not conflate regularization-compatibility with anomaly cancellation." |
| **M-35** (Symp$_{\mathrm{form}}$-equivariance per-theorem, not (∞,1)-uniform) | Plan does not engage with this distinction | **W3-W13-25: §6 voice or §7 N1 expansion.** Add: "Symp$_{\mathrm{form}}(\mathbb C^2,0)$-equivariance is verified per-theorem; we do not claim (∞,1)-uniform Symp-equivariance across all theorem blocks." |
| **M-36** (Distribution-product avoidance structural, not by fiat) | Plan §6 item 7 + §7 N9 install distribution-locality but with "by fiat" wording per M-23 | **W3-W13-26: §7 N9 expansion.** Make the avoidance structural (i.e., proven from coadjoint Jacobi + smearing $a(bB)-b(aB)=abB$ for smooth $a,b$ and distribution $B$), not declared by fiat. |
| **M-37** (Sharpened R-03 four-ingredient closure plan) | Plan §4 Obligation VII is high-level | **W3-W13-27: §4 Obligation VII expansion.** Adopt M-37's four ingredients: (1) Weiss descent for the brane-line factorization construction; (2) global Hamiltonian sheaf $\mathcal H$ with period choice; (3) holomorphic-symplectic anomaly bookkeeping; (4) global U(1)/Capelli class transfer. |

## T5. Recommendations — M-XX entries to add or sharpen

The following 27 W3-W13-prefixed entries should be added to the master ledger. Numbering is contiguous in the W3-W13 namespace; severities mirror the underlying critique.

| ID | Title | Severity | Origin |

| W3-W13-9 | Divergence-free ⇒ Hamiltonian Poincaré-lemma derivation in §2 Principle 1 | 3 | C35 |
| W3-W13-10 | A-brane $\otimes$ B-brane $\otimes$ Koszul-resolution origin of open BV in §3 Theorem A | 3 | C36 |

| W3-W13-12 | Apologetic-phrasing blacklist in §5 voice | 2 | C207 |
| W3-W13-13 | Negative-index zero-target convention in §6 item 8 | 2 | C227 |
| W3-W13-14 | $\Theta_\rho$ parity/pairing/density precision in §6 item 12 | 3 | C239–C241 |
| W3-W13-15 | Numbered finite-Lie toy lemma in §7 N1 | 4 | C243 |
| W3-W13-16 | $\psi$-degree convention statement in §6 item 8 | 3 | C254 |
| W3-W13-17 | §3 Theorem C explicit split into C₁ / C₂ matching M-01 | 5 | M-01 |
| W3-W13-18 | §4 Obligation II reformulation matching M-02 | 5 | M-02 |
| W3-W13-19 | §6 item 8 specific shift convention resolution per M-07 | 4 | M-07 |
| W3-W13-20 | §3 Theorem G weight-bidegree decomposition lemma per M-09 | 2 | M-09 |
| W3-W13-21 | §4 Obligation III re-wording (admissible-only, no $q\to 1^+$) per M-11 | 3 | M-11 |
| W3-W13-22 | Bosonic vs $\mathfrak{gl}(N\|N)$ supertrace remark in §3 Theorem A or §1 per M-13 | 1 | M-13 |
| W3-W13-23 | §4 Obligation VII Weiss-cosheaf-descent residual explicit per M-14 | 3 | M-14 |
| W3-W13-24 | §4 Obligation IV regularization-compatible vs anomaly-cancellation distinction per M-32 | 4 | M-32 |

| W3-W13-27 | §4 Obligation VII four-ingredient closure plan per M-37 | 3 | M-37 |

**Critical drops (severity ≥4 not addressed by plan).** Five drops require highest-priority sharpening: **W3-W13-5** (M-03 derived intersection), **W3-W13-6** (graphwise vs renormalizable), **W3-W13-15** (toy-lemma), **W3-W13-17** (Theorem C split per M-01), **W3-W13-18** (Obligation II per M-02), **W3-W13-24** (M-32). The Theorem C split (W3-W13-17) is the load-bearing one — without it the plan's central theorem statement holds an implicit hypothesis (Tate-conilpotency) that fails for the perfect formal disk, exactly as M-01 diagnoses.

**Plan sections requiring direct edits:** §2 (Principle 1 derivation, Symp covariance), §3 (Theorem A finite-$N$ commuting variety remark + jet contraction; Theorem C split into C₁/C₂; Theorem G weight-bidegree lemma), §4 (Obligations II, III, IV, V, VII reformulation), §5 (voice phrase blacklist), §6 (notation index disambiguations + sign appendix expansions), §7 (N1 numbered toy lemma + Symp covariance call-out + N9 structural distribution-product avoidance).

## Summary (200 words)

This audit catalogs 287 distinct critique items (C01-C287) extracted in chunks from the 11366-line whitepaper-critical-analysis transcript covering six rounds: hostile-referee attack (C01-C17), constructive derived-center proposal (C18-C24), Diracian rewrite (C25-C33), first-principles synthesis (C34-C68), v3 second-pass (C69-C86), and exhaustive 201-item technical punch list (C87-C287). Cross-mapped against the 979-line `platonic-ideal-plan-2026-04-28.md` and the 37-entry master ledger `attack-heal-platonic-2026-04-28.md`, most items are classified A (addressed). Substantively, the platonic plan is faithful to the critique on the central theorem (CE/PV derived center, principal-part Matlis dual, no-go for $\Psi\to\rho$ as $\mathfrak h$-module, scalar U(1)/Capelli line, Costello as conditional analytic obligation, regulator status of weighted Tate). The audit identifies 13 silent drops or dilutions (S/P) and 11 master-ledger heals (M-01, M-02, M-03, M-07, M-09, M-11, M-13, M-14, M-32, M-35, M-36, M-37) that the plan does not yet propagate. The recommended 27 W3-W13- entries cover all gaps. Five (W3-W13-5/-6/-15/-17/-18/-24) are severity 4-5 and should be added first; the load-bearing one is W3-W13-17 (Theorem C explicit C₁/C₂ split per M-01).
