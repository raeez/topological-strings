"""W3 / wave-2 attack-heal: explicit N=2 derived-intersection verification.

This script attacks master ledger entry M-03 with concrete linear algebra at
N=2.  The ground ring is

    R_2 = C[phi_1^{ij}, phi_2^{ij}]    for 1 <= i,j <= 2,    8 even generators,

and the BV exterior factor is

    Lambda_2 = Lambda(psi^{ij})        for 1 <= i,j <= 2,    4 odd generators.

The reduced BV complex of Theorem A is

    A_N(N=2) = R_2 \otimes Lambda_2,    Q phi_i = 0,    Q psi^{ij} = [phi_1, phi_2]^{ij}.

Master ledger M-03 says: the commuting variety of pairs of NxN matrices is
not a complete intersection for N >= 2; therefore the Koszul complex on
mu = [phi_1, phi_2] = 0 is not exact, and the BV cohomology is the *derived*
intersection.

Steps performed.
  1. Verify the moment-map zero locus is irreducible of dimension 6 = 2*N + 2
     for N = 2 (Gerstenhaber 1961; Motzkin-Taussky 1955).  (We verify the
     equation count: 4 commutator equations of which only 3 are independent
     because Tr [X,Y] = 0; codim is 2, not 4.)
  2. Verify Tr psi is a Q-cycle: Q(Tr psi) = Tr [phi_1, phi_2] = 0 by
     cyclicity.  This is a chain-level avatar of the derived intersection.
  3. Compute the linear part of the Koszul differential on Lambda^1 -> R_2
     and verify it lands in the image of [X,Y] = 0.  The kernel of this
     linear map is the space of psi-monomials hit by polynomial coefficients
     to give 0 mod [X,Y].  At fixed bidegree we check the Tor^0 / Tor^1
     dimensions explicitly.
  4. Verify Tr psi is *not* a coboundary.
  5. N = 1 boundary stratum: confirm [phi_1, phi_2] = 0 automatically, the
     Koszul differential is zero, Tr psi is a non-trivial degree-1 class
     trivially.  This is the boundary stratum of Wave 2 lens E1.
  6. N = 3 confirmation: the same calculation grows; we tabulate dimensions.

The script DOES NOT compute global Tor over the polynomial ring (that is a
Macaulay2 / explicit minimal-free-resolution job).  What it does is:
   (a) verify the chain-level avatar Tr psi is Q-closed for general N;
   (b) verify it is not a coboundary for N=2 (because the moment map
       components are not units);
   (c) check the dimension count predicted by Gerstenhaber/Motzkin-Taussky.

def test_U1_ghost_protection_status() -> str:
    """Status of U(1)_ghost anomaly-freeness in 1d gl_N matrix mechanics.

    Wave 1 heal claimed: extension of ghost-zero truncation to quantum
    requires U(1)_ghost anomaly-freeness.  We attack: is this assumed or
    proved?

    Findings (cross-referenced against Costello, *Renormalization and
    Effective Field Theory* (AMS Math. Surveys 170, 2011), Chapter 5,
    and Henneaux-Teitelboim, *Quantization of Gauge Systems* (Princeton,
    1992), Chapter 18):

    1. In the BV formalism the BRST/ghost number is a cohomological
       grading on the BV complex.  In a 1d topological theory with
       *finite-dimensional* gauge symmetry, the U(1)_ghost is a
       global symmetry of the classical BV complex.

    2. At the quantum level, U(1)_ghost is a symmetry of the BV master
       equation iff the regularization scheme respects it.  In Costello's
       cutoff scheme on a 1-manifold, the heat kernel preserves
       U(1)_ghost because the ghost number is integer-valued on the
       basis of fields and the heat kernel propagates the same field type
       to itself.  This is *not* an anomaly-freeness theorem; it is a
       compatibility statement.

    3. The actual U(1)_ghost anomaly in finite-dim gauge systems is the
       "ghost-anomaly" of Henneaux-Teitelboim Sec. 18.3, which equals
       the trace anomaly of the gauge generators -- in our case
       Tr_{gl_N}(I) = N times the identity grading on R_2 \otimes
       Lambda_2.  This is *consistent* with the master ledger's claim
       that the U(1)/Capelli anomaly is the line spanned by [\bar c]
       with coefficient N.

    4. Conclusion: U(1)_ghost protection in 1d is not literally a
       nontrivial anomaly-freeness theorem; it is the statement that the
       only anomaly that *could* obstruct the lift is the same Capelli
       N-shift already classified by Theorem G.  W3 confirms wave 1's
       heal claim is structurally correct but its phrasing should
       distinguish "U(1)_ghost preserved by regularization (free
       statement)" from "the only anomaly is the Capelli class
       (provable)".

    Reference: Costello *RenEFT* Sec. 5.3, "Ghost numbers and the
    quantum master equation", does *not* prove a finite-dim gl_N ghost
    anomaly cancellation theorem; it sets up the scheme.  The actual
    cancellation in the present paper is part of Obligation IV
    (mixed brane-defect QME), still open.
    """
    return ("U(1)_ghost protection in 1d for gl_N matrix mechanics is "

# ---------- Theorem G identification: Tr psi vs omega(z_1, z_2) -------------


def test_TrPsi_vs_omega() -> str:
    """Identification of chain-level Tr psi class with omega(z_1, z_2) class.

    Theorem G (lem:omega-cocycle, thm:u1-center-anomaly): the cocycle
       omega(z_1, z_2) = 1 in H^2_Lie(\bar A; C)
    is the distinguished anomaly line.  The boundary realization is
       {Tr phi_1, Tr phi_2} = N.

    Master ledger M-03 says: BV complex computes derived intersection,
    Tr psi is the chain-level avatar.

    Comparison:
      * On the closed CE side the U(1) anomaly is parametrized by
        omega and lives in cohomological degree 2.
      * On the open BV side Tr psi lives in cohomological degree -1
        (one antifield).
      * The CE/PV theorem (Theorem C) sends u_I -> O_I and c^I -> theta^I.
        Under this map, the dual of the constant Hamiltonian (the
        scalar-axis line Tr(1) = N) maps to the Hamiltonian vector field
        operation theta_1, which sees the central element via the
        cocycle.

    Heal proposal: the chain-level Tr psi class IS the BV-side image of
    the closed [\bar c] anomaly line under the derived-intersection
    correspondence.  The map is *not* a degree-shifting isomorphism on
    individual chain modules; it is a quasi-isomorphism after passing
    to total cohomology of the closed-open factorization complex.

    In particular: the U(1)/Capelli class as the derived-intersection
    1-loop anomaly (M-03 narrative) and the U(1)/Capelli class as the
    closed CE 2-cocycle (Theorem G) are the SAME line, viewed from two
    sides of the CE/PV identification.

    The explicit comparison map is constructed by:
      1. Tr psi at N=2 generates a Q-closed degree-(-1) class.
      2. Under the CE/PV map of Theorem C, Tr psi corresponds to the
         u-coordinate dual to the constant Hamiltonian generator.
      3. The constant Hamiltonian generator is precisely the line
         removed in the passage h_poly -> \bar A; the dual of removing
         this generator is the cocycle [\bar c] of Theorem G.
      4. Therefore [Tr psi] (chain-level) and [\bar c] (CE-level) are
         in canonical bijection through the CE/PV / boundary-evaluation
         diagram.

    Status: this identification is the ledger-recommended re-narration
    of Theorems A and G.  The script verifies the chain-level
    Q-closedness; the CE-side identification is the content of Theorem G;
    the bridge is the unproved part (Obligation I, the unreduced BV
    factorization-centre lift).
